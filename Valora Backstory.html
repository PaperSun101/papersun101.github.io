            <p>Sometimes you can be so into books, that even your family of wizards agree that you need to get out more.</p>
            <aside>
                <p>Also when I say wizard, I don't mean Harry Potter style or anything else. No sir, we are talking DnD 5e, just to set the tone. I'm also going to write this like a wikipedia article
                    because the thought just came to mind and it amuses me.

                <h3 id="Valora Backstory"> Backstory</h3>
                    <p> Born to Valen and Keva Renir, Valora grew up pretty average for her family in every way shape and form. Growing up in the city of Silyari Valora was a studious and dedicated student
                    of the magical arts, with a gift for illusions from a young age. Her talents suited her disposition, for she adored consuming as many books about the outside world as she could, content
                    to use her magic to bring scenes from her imagination to life instead of seeing them herself. Her marks in class were decently high, her family comfortably merchant 
                    class, Valora sought an easy life of study and scholarly persuits and would have happily lived centuries never having set foot outside of Silyari, and she would have been able to do so
                    if not for one pesky family tradition.
                    </p>

                    <p>While her family, both her mother and father's side, stressed the importance of a magical education, they also saw the value of not only reading about your craft, but seeking out new
                        knowledge in new places. While her father Valen simply wanted her to see how the non elven masses lived, to observe them as a scientist might observe an experiment, her mother 
                        was much more worldly and accepcting of others, and it was her dearest hope that her rather narrowminded and supieror daughter might learn some humility in the outside world as her 
                        maternal ancestors did long ago. That their high elven arrogance was not only unbecomming, but unfounded as well. And so when Valora reached 120 years of age, her time had come to seize
                        her place as a true adult among her people. To travel to new lands and to not return until she brought back previously unknown knowledge to their family, so that she gave back to those that
                        imparted their own to her. And as the lastest first born of the first born of the Renir family, she had another burden to bear; a mysterious armband that would sometimes grow warm, older
                        than the most ancient Elven memory of her people. It was a treasure from an impossible age, and should she trimuph where her ancestors had failed and uncover its origins, she would return
                        home a hero.
                    </p>

                    <p>With a heavy heart and little but her well loved robes and that band cold and heavy on her arm, Valora set out for distant lands she had only read about on her own, determined to prove to
                        all that had doubted her that really, all you needed to be successful in life could be found in books if you read hard enough. She would bring back treasure and wisdom the likes of which no 
                        Renir OR Enora had seen in centuries! And perhaps, if she could spare the time, she might figure out what was wrong with this stupid hunk of gold along the way. Maybe.</p>

                <h3 id="Valora Personality">Personality</h3>
                    <p>Unfortunately for the vast majority of people that Valora meets, she is your typical stuck up and wholely out of touch high elven asshole. She has a good heart and would rather help than harm,
                        but at the end of the day Valora is looking out for her and her own. However once she has decided she wants to help, once she has decided there is a wrong that she thinks she can fix, laws and 
                        rules be damned, she will do what it takes to protect those who cannot protect themselves. But her cautious nature stays her hand and tongue at times; after all, an elf dying young is a terrible
                        terrible thing, centuries of potential would be lost! A poor liar, Valora learned to be honest to a fault. She would rather be hated for who she is than liked for who she is not, not that the opinions
                        of others often bothers her. And while she knows when to hold her tongue, she would always prefer to say what is on her mind, helpful or hurtful. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Initially, Valora didn't respect much of anyone that didn't have pointed ears. She could treat them courteously, but it was much like how someone that liked a talking dog might behave; with condesending
                        surprise and the general air that she was humoring them. However as she traveled with her new found friends, and lost one along the way, she has begun to learn that her mother might have been on to somthing.
                        Maybe, just maybe, the sun didn't rise and set for the sun elves themselves. Maybe there are things, a lot of things, her people do not know and they could learn to respect and listen to others. After a few
                        run ins with those with that have much more extreme views her, looking to hurt and subjugate the "lower" beings around them, Valora was horrified and scared of what they could do to innocents just because they 
                        thought they were better. And after many nights of intospection she realized that while her selfish beliefs were lower on that same spectrum, they fed from the same well of intolerace and the idea of that terrified her.
                        After everything she has seen and done, after the mistakes her people made unable and unwilling to see others as equals, Valora has come to the conclusion that the attitude she left home with cannot be the one 
                        she returns with. Her mother was right all along; she needs to, can, and will be better.
