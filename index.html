    <p>
        This is where I am exploring, and surely at some point destroying, my work with websites. As such there will be little rhyme
        or reason to what is posted here; it will be what ever strikes my fancy at the moment. </br> I have a few things I'd like to
        accomplish here;
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>To be able to use HTML well enough to be comfortable</li>
        <li>Then to move onto CSS and make it pretty</li>
        <li>Then to JS to make it do interesting things and to make me want to bash my head in from what I've heard of it</li>
        <li>????</li>
        <li>Make money doing this some day!</li>
    </ol>
