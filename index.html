        This is where I am exploring, and surely at some point destroying, my work with websites. As such there will be little rhyme
        or reason to what is posted here; it will be what ever strikes my fancy at the moment. Also HTML tables stink omg</br> I have a few things I'd like to
        accomplish here;
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>To be able to use HTML well enough to be comfortable</li>
        <li>Then to move onto CSS and make it pretty</li>
        <li>Then to JS to make it do interesting things and to make me want to bash my head in from what I've heard of it</li>
        <li>????</li>
        <li>Make money doing this some day!</li>
    </ol>

            <h2>Yandere boys</h2>
            <p>This is something to help me figure out the relationship between articles, aside and sections. So we're gonna talk about the sociopaths of otome games.</p>
            <aside>
                <p>Also if you're wondering what a yandere is, or are thinking I've kinda heard of this, or like tsundere... does it have something to do with that? You would be correct! There are a 
                bunch of "dere" types and I'll be happy to lay them out here later.</p>
            </aside>
            <section>
                <h3>Toma</h3>
                <p>Okay so I think he would be a lot less divisive as a yandere character if a certain... thing was optional. Anyone that has played Amnesia KNOWS what the thing I speak of is. It just
                feels waaaayyy too wtf when you realize that you can't prevent it! Like she always gets back with him and it just doesn't make sense. I think part of the yandere appeal needs to have
                the other person react in a kinda rational way, or you need to tell us she is as coo coo for cocoa puffs as he is. She can't kinda react right sometimes and then not, it feels weird.</p>
