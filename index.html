        This is where I am exploring, and surely at some point destroying, my work with websites. As such there will be little rhyme
        or reason to what is posted here; it will be what ever strikes my fancy at the moment. Also HTML tables stink omg</br> I have a few things I'd like to
        accomplish here;
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>To be able to use HTML well enough to be comfortable</li>
        <li>Then to move onto CSS and make it pretty</li>
        <li>Then to JS to make it do interesting things and to make me want to bash my head in from what I've heard of it</li>
        <li>????</li>
        <li>Make money doing this some day!</li>
    </ol>

            <h2>Amnesia Memories Review</h2>
            <p>This is something to help me figure out the relationship between articles, aside and sections. So we're gonna talk about otome games.</p>
            <aside>
                <p>Also if you're wondering what a yandere is, or are thinking I've kinda heard of this, or like what's a tsundere.. There are a bunch of "dere" types and I'll be happy to lay them out
                here later.</p>

                <h3> Spoiler Free Overview</h3>
                <p> Released in 2013 in Japan and 2015 in the US, Amnesia: Memories is a pretty popular title with otome game veterans and newcomers alike. Our main character, who will be referred to 
                    from here on as MC due to the fact one can name her whatever they like, ends up losing her memories due to a supernatural accident with a little spirit boy named Orion. From here 
                    you have the choice between 4 worlds to go to with a 5th secret world, with each world consisting of the same characters with different relationships and circumstances in each with 
                    some common factors. For example, the boyfriend of one world may be the friend of a friend in another. It's up to you to not only figure out how to regain your memories, but to keep 
                    your amnesia a secret as you try to find your happily ever after with a guy you hardly remember, much less know at that point.</p>

                    <p>Overall I would say that I quite enjoyed this game. Due to this being my first otome game that I had ever played when I purchased it, it lacks something that I have since found is 
                    pretty common; a <a href="https://rosegoldchai.wordpress.com/page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common route</a>. I actually really enjoyed this, because a common route is usually
                    pretty awesome the first or second time around. However, after you are on your 3rd playthough, 4th or 5th, and if you forget and save over your fastforward save to skip the fluff and
                    get to the part where your choices matter more... being able to jump right in to your chosen guy's story is great. Between the main four guys, each is quite distinctive from the 
                    other, with Shin, Toma, Ikki, and Kent each falling into their own little anime archtype box, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  One thing that does stand out quite a bit though 
                    is the MC's lack of a personality. While it absolutely makes sense in context, others I have spoken to find it a little off putting, due to how it leads to a rather passive MC. She 
                    doesn't know who she is, what her likes or dislikes are, what she had for breakfast the morning before the accident, she's a clean slate. If you like to self-insert this is great, 
                    but it puts the breaks on for anyone looking for a stronger personality.</p>

                    <p>However I would say that the story has a polarizing way of dealing with this; that previously mentioned spirit boy. Unlike the MC, Orion has a very strong personality with his mind 
                    being melded with hers he can see and feel everything happening to her if he so chooses (don't worry, he gets outta there when needed). He provides a lot of the inner dialogue, 
                    reactions, and thinking that the MC doesn't really engage in much, as well as being someone for her to confide in and talk about the events of each day with. Some people have really 
                    hated this, feeling that he was intrusive and annoying, with his loud high pitched voice and questionable advice at times. Others, such as myself, thought he was a great addition! 
                    I thought he was adorable, and his reactions often matched up with my own. I can't tell you how many times he would be indignant at something one of the characters did, and I would 
                    find myself leaning into the screen nodding furiously going "I know, right?!" By the end I wanted a little brother route where you would just take him out to get cake and gossip 
                    about all of your crazy boyfriends. I really feel like I would miss the little guy if he weren't there. If you would like to avoid any spoilers (Or you just want that TL;DR, no 
                    shame in that!), you can scroll on to the bottom for a quick overview on what I thought of the game overall.</p>

                    <p>Below you will find the indiviual route reviews, which will be <strong>FULL OF SPOILERS</strong>, so you have been throughly warned.</p>

                <h3>Toma</h3>
                    <p>Alright so lets get these route reviews going with a bang! Here I present to you the one true oniichan above them all, the nicest dude you'll ever meet until he's not, and one of 
                    the most infamous otome yandere to date, Toma! Alrighty so, from the very start of the game this dude lies to you about being your boyfriend and he manages to hide that pretty well.
                    Initially, Toma was very sweet to the MC, doting on her and trying to keep her safe whenever possible. I was kinda feeling it, thinking ah he seems to be a sweet guy, a little over 
                    protective, but manageable, okay let's do this. But then his Happy Meal starts to lose french fries pretty dang fast. At first he's content to do little shady things, like being a 
                    bit over bearing with worrying, stealing the battery to her laptop so she can't check her email and see the evil malicious emails she's being sent by her co-worker's psycho fangirls
                    (Cell phone? Anyone? No?), but as she keeps having close calls with being hurt he just starts slipping down the crazy slope. Next thing you know he's trying to keep her at his place
                    as much as possible, first making excuses, and eventually, as you shriek your frustration at the screen about her not running for the hills like 2 weeks ago because the whole 
                    situation was clearly wrong from the start, he does away with even hiding it and drugs her to keep her house bound. When that's not enough... he gets her a dog cage! Even had the 
                    nerve to complain about how hard it was to find one big enough. But don't worry! This is only temporary since she kept doing unreasonable things, like trying to leave the house, 
                    until he takes care of the fangirls. I mean there's no chance that this too could escalate, just like everything else. Trust your Toma-chan.</br>

                    </br>Right.</p>

                    <p>You know, I'm gonna be honest here, I kinda love yanderes. When they're done right they are super interesting characters to me, I end up getting invested in just how far is this guy
                    going to go with this, what is he getting up to! It's thrilling in the way that only something I never, ever, want to experience in real life can be. So when I say I didn't really
                    enjoy his route, it's not because he's a little basket of crazy. I honestly just felt like I could never win with him, mostly because the cage thing? That is a fixed event in every 
                    single one of his endings; <em>it doesn't matter what you do.</em> And that is the crux of the issue here I think. At no point do you ever feel like you can "win" with him so to 
                    speak, because to do so you must forgive him for drugging your character and stuffing her in cage. Unlike the other routes with little hiccups that might tick the average person 
                    off, but you see how they could look past it to get to that sweet sweet good ending, the cage is such a huge deal that it messes up momentum of his story. Because from the moment it 
                    happens a lot of us are like "She's okay with this?! Like she's really going to get with a guy that's gonna trap her, like physically trap her in a dog cage. Okay. OKAY, like... 
                    wow." and the suspension of disbelief that had been crying out for dear mercy the whole route finally collapses. Oh and let me add that the story doesn't outline how she's as 
                    twisted as he is. Like from my POV she seemed to be a pretty rational person until she gets over this which is the other issue for me. If they had shown she was a batty as he was in
                    another way I would have been okay with it like okay turns out she's nuts! Wow it explains so much about her reactions. There is a hint of codependency there, but between her freak 
                    outs and trying to get away before forgiving him, it just doesn't feel right. To me her forgiveness seems to be the other indication that she's off.</p>

                    <p>Overall his route was... decent. Like I didn't hate him but it felt like there were too many things the MC had to be overlooking and ignoring for his route to truly make sense.</p>

                <h3>Ikki</h3>
                <p> Okay, this is another one that left me going hmmmmm by the end. But oh hey tie ins, remeber those crazy fan girls that made Toma freak? They are hooked on this guy right here and he totally fails to deal with them! And here is part of my issue with his route. </p>
