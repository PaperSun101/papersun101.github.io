<h1>Welcome to Rosegold Chai</h1>
<p>This is where I am exploring, and surely at some point destroying, my work with websites. As such there will be little rhyme
  or reason to what is posted here; it will be what ever strikes my fancy at the moment. </br> I have a few things I'd like to 
  accomplish here;</p>
  <ol>
    <li>To be able to use HTML well enough to be comfortable</li>
    <li>Then to move onto CSS and make it pretty</li>
    <li>Then to JS to make it do interesting things and to make me want to bash my head in from what I've heard of it</li?
    <li>????</li>
  <li>Profit and make money doing this some day!</li>
  </ol>
